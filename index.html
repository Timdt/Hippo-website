  <h1 class="test">How the Hippo has become endangered and why he is so important</h1>
  <h2>Hippos are endangered mainly because poachers hunt them for their meat and the ivory in their teeth. Other threats are habitat loss due to the encroachment
   of human settlements and the diversion of river water for agriculture.

  Where do hippopotamuses live?<br>
  Two hippo species are found in Africa. The large hippo, found in East Africa, occurs south of the Sahara. The other, much smaller (440 to 605 pounds)
  species of hippo is the pygmy hippopotamus. Limited to very restricted ranges in West Africa, it is a shy, solitary forest dweller and is now rare.
  <br><br>
  Challenges:<br>
  Hippo populations are threatened by hunting.
  Hundreds of hippos are shot each year to minimize human-wildlife conflict, despite the fact that ditches or low fences easily deter hippos. It is more likely that the popularity of hippo meat is the reason for this strategy. Hippo fat and ivory tusks are also valuable to humans.

  Humans are pushing hippos out of their habitats.
  As human populations grow, they encroach on wildlife habitats as they build new settlements,
  increase agricultural production, and construct new roads. The hippo once ranged from the Nile Delta to the Cape, but now it is mostly confined to protected areas.
